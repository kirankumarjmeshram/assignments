Here are 10 custom hooks problem statements in React that you can use:

### 1. **useFetch**

* **Problem Statement:** Create a custom hook `useFetch` that takes a URL as input and returns the fetched data, loading state, and any error that occurred during the fetch operation. Implement features like automatic retries and caching of data.

### 2. **useLocalStorage**

* **Problem Statement:** Create a custom hook `useLocalStorage` that allows saving and retrieving values from the browser's local storage. The hook should support setting default values and automatically parse/serialize JSON objects.

### 3. **useDebounce**

* **Problem Statement:** Implement a `useDebounce` hook that delays the execution of a function until after a specified wait time has passed since the last time the function was invoked. This is useful for optimizing performance in search input fields.

### 4. **useWindowSize**

* **Problem Statement:** Create a `useWindowSize` hook that tracks the browser windowâ€™s dimensions. The hook should update the width and height values dynamically when the window is resized.

### 5. **usePrevious**

* **Problem Statement:** Develop a `usePrevious` hook that stores and returns the previous value of a state or prop, which can be useful for comparison in functional components.

### 6. **useHover**

* **Problem Statement:** Write a `useHover` hook that detects when a user hovers over an element. The hook should return a boolean indicating whether the element is being hovered over.

### 7. **useOnClickOutside**

* **Problem Statement: Build a `useOnClickOutside` hook that triggers a callback function when a user clicks outside of a specified component. This can be used to close dropdowns or modals when clicking outside of them.**

### 8. **useTimeout**

* **Problem Statement:** Implement a `useTimeout` hook that allows you to set up a timer that triggers a callback after a specified delay. The hook should also support canceling the timeout before it completes.

### 9. **useIntersectionObserver**

* **Problem Statement:** Create a `useIntersectionObserver` hook that tracks the visibility of an element on the page using the Intersection Observer API. It should notify when the element enters or leaves the viewport.

### 10. **useMediaQuery**

* **Problem Statement: Write a `useMediaQuery` hook that accepts a media query string and returns a boolean indicating whether the media query matches the current viewport size. This is useful for responsive design.**
